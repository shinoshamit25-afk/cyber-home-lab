# Cyber-home-lab
An environment where I train and find the unknown in the known!

In this project I practiced the use of SIEM or Security Information and Event Management systems with the help of Microsoft Azure.
In this project I created a free Azure subscription, deployed a virtual machine exposed to the internet, configured log forwarding into an Azure Log Analytics workspace, and integrated logs into Sentinel for real-time analysis.
I used Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query and visualise logs — including failed login attempts — and constructed an attack map to visualise the geographic origin of those attacks.
